## 🧠 What Is SmartAgentX?

**SmartAgentX Playground** is a lightweight web-based simulation of an autonomous agent.  
It takes a goal (like _“find startup ideas”_) and breaks it into an intelligent plan of actions.

> Think: AutoGPT, but simplified, beautiful, and decentralized.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 Simple goal input (natural language)
- ⚡ Generates a 4-step action plan instantly
- 🎨 Sleek dark UI in less than 100 lines of code
- 💸 Tokenize access via `$SMARTX` (coming soon)
- 🌍 Runs 100% in browser — no API, no backend, no tracking
